## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Update `AppShell` to use a fixed-height shell on desktop so header/sider remain visible and only content scrolls
- [x] 1.2 Update Jobs workspace desktop layout to use pane-scoped scrolling (jobs list pane + job workspace pane)
- [x] 1.3 Make Jobs list filters sticky/pinned within the list pane (reduce context loss while scrolling)
- [x] 1.4 Make job header + section tabs sticky/pinned within the job workspace pane (while section content scrolls)
- [x] 1.5 Verify mobile layout remains single-column and does not introduce scroll trapping
- [x] 1.6 Add lightweight regression tests (structure/classes) for scroll container invariants where feasible
- [x] 1.7 Run `scripts/ci.sh`
