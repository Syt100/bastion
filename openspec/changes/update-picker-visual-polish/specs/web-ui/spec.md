## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Picker Tables Have Clear Yet Subtle Visual Hierarchy
The picker tables SHALL use a clear but subtle visual hierarchy to improve readability on both desktop and mobile.

#### Scenario: Hover and selection are visually distinguishable
- **GIVEN** a picker modal renders a list of entries
- **WHEN** the user hovers a row or selects it
- **THEN** the hover/selected state is visually distinguishable without making the table look overly heavy
